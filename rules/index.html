<p><span class="bold">General rules and behaviour:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>All chat is rated <a href="http://www.cbbfc.co.uk/pg">PG</a>, regardless of the game I play.</li>
  <li>Discussion   of anything religious, political or unlawful is not allowed. Same goes   for Adblock. These topics are divisive and create arguments.</li>
  <li>Feel free to be yourself but always remain respectful to me, my moderators and all viewers watching.</li>
  <li>Do not ask for giveaways, for people to donate money or for a change of game.</li>
  <li>Feel free to be helpful and offer me advice but don't back-seat game and tell me what to do.</li>
  <li>Ignore trolls. They crave your attention and mine. Let the moderators deal with them.</li>
  <li>Don't ask to be a moderator. Wait until applications are open and then apply.</li>
  <li>No coloured text or ASCII art.</li>
  <li>Links require approval from a moderator. Tell them what the link is. If   they approve then you will be able to post it. </li>
  <li>English language is the only language to be used in chat.</li>
  <li>Follow the rules, have fun, stay classy and share the love &lt;3</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="bold">Ban-able Offences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising yourself, channels, streams,   products, accounts, events etc. without asking a mod first will usually   lead to an immediate ban. If you are unsure, ask a mod first. You have   been warned.</li>
  <li>Racism/sexism/homophobia or hate towards me or others will simply not be tolerated. Have respect for everyone.</li>
  <li>If   you repeatedly cause offence, disrupt the stream or prevent others from   enjoying my streams and ignore the moderators' warnings and timeouts</li>
  <li>Impersonation</li>
  <li>Lewd or offensive Twitch names or names aimed to troll the streamer or moderators</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bold">Time-out Offences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spamming messages or shouting WITH CAPS. Maybe I   missed your comment the first time, maybe I chose not to respond to it.   If you keep repeating a message or shouting it you will likely get   timed out. This means you won't be able to chat for a short period of   time. If this happens then take some time to chill until the time-out   automatically expires.</li>
  <li>Posting spoilers about a game I am playing (unless I specifically asked for help).</li>
  <li>Posting spoilers about sporting events taking place whilst I am streaming.</li>
</ul>
